# Database Migration Research and Strategy

## Issue #8: Research and Plan Database Migration

### Current State Analysis

**Current Setup:**
- Using H2 in-memory database for development
- Spring Boot 3.5.3 with Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate DDL auto-generation (`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop`)
- No formal migration strategy
- Schema changes handled manually

**Current Entities:**
- `User`: id, name, email
- `OutreachAction`: id, type (enum), dateTime, notes, user (foreign key)

**Current API Structure:**
- Request DTOs: `CreateOutreachActionRequest`
- Response DTOs: `OutreachActionResponse`, `CreateOutreachActionResponse`, `OutreachActionDetailResponse`
- Controllers: `OutreachActionController`, `UserController`
- Service Layer: `OutreachActionService`, `OutreachActionServiceImpl`
- Mappers: `OutreachActionMapper` (MapStruct)

## Migration Tools Comparison: Flyway vs Liquibase

### Flyway

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Simplicity**: SQL-first approach, easy to understand
- ✅ **Spring Boot Integration**: Excellent out-of-the-box support (`spring-boot-starter-flyway`)
- ✅ **Performance**: Lightweight and fast execution
- ✅ **Version Control**: Simple versioning scheme (V1__Description.sql)
- ✅ **Community**: Large community, extensive documentation
- ✅ **Learning Curve**: Minimal learning curve for developers familiar with SQL
- ✅ **Rollback**: Supports rollback in paid version (Flyway Teams/Enterprise)

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Database Agnostic**: Less database-agnostic than Liquibase
- ❌ **Advanced Features**: Limited advanced features in free version
- ❌ **Complex Rollbacks**: Rollback requires manual scripts or paid version

**Best For:**
- Teams comfortable with SQL
- Simple to moderate migration complexity
- Projects prioritizing simplicity and performance

### Liquibase

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Database Agnostic**: Excellent cross-database compatibility
- ✅ **XML/YAML/JSON Support**: Multiple formats for migration scripts
- ✅ **Advanced Features**: Rich set of features (contexts, labels, preconditions)
- ✅ **Rollback Support**: Built-in rollback capabilities in free version
- ✅ **Change Tracking**: Detailed change tracking and validation
- ✅ **Spring Boot Integration**: Good integration with Spring Boot

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Complexity**: Steeper learning curve
- ❌ **Performance**: Can be slower than Flyway for large migrations
- ❌ **Overhead**: More configuration and setup required
- ❌ **XML Verbosity**: XML format can be verbose for simple changes

**Best For:**
- Multi-database environments
- Complex migration requirements
- Teams needing advanced rollback capabilities

## Tool Recommendation: **Flyway**

### Justification

For the Sales Metrics API project, **Flyway is the recommended choice** based on:

1. **Project Characteristics:**
   - Single database target (PostgreSQL for production)
   - Relatively simple schema
   - Small development team
   - Focus on rapid development

2. **Team Considerations:**
   - SQL-first approach aligns with typical Spring Boot development
   - Minimal learning curve
   - Excellent Spring Boot integration

3. **Technical Benefits:**
   - Lightweight and performant
   - Simple version control integration
   - Clear migration file naming convention
   - Extensive community support

4. **Cost-Effectiveness:**
   - Free version covers project needs
   - Rollback can be handled with manual scripts for simple schema

## Production Database Recommendation: **PostgreSQL**

### Justification

**PostgreSQL** is recommended over MySQL for:

1. **Technical Advantages:**
   - Superior JSON support (beneficial for future features)
   - Better handling of complex queries
   - ACID compliance and data integrity
   - Advanced indexing capabilities

2. **Ecosystem Compatibility:**
   - Excellent Spring Boot/JPA support
   - Strong Flyway integration
   - Wide adoption in Spring ecosystem

3. **Future-Proofing:**
   - Better performance for analytical queries (metrics calculation)
   - Extensibility for future advanced features
   - Strong community and long-term support

## Migration Strategy Overview

### Phase 1: Tool Integration (Week 1)
1. Add Flyway dependency to project
2. Configure Flyway in application properties
3. Create initial migration structure
4. Test with current H2 setup

### Phase 2: Schema Migrations (Week 1-2)
1. Create baseline migration for existing schema
2. Develop migration scripts for current entities
3. Add sample data migration
4. Test migration rollback procedures

### Phase 3: Production Database Setup (Week 2-3)
1. Set up PostgreSQL development environment
2. Configure application for multiple profiles (H2 dev, PostgreSQL prod)
3. Test full migration pipeline
4. Document deployment procedures

### Phase 4: Validation and Documentation (Week 3-4)
1. Create comprehensive migration documentation
2. Establish migration best practices
3. Train team on new procedures
4. Create rollback emergency procedures

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Add Flyway dependency to pom.xml
   - Create migration directory structure
   - Configure Flyway properties

2. **Short-term Goals:**
   - Implement baseline migrations
   - Set up PostgreSQL development environment
   - Create sample migration scripts

3. **Long-term Considerations:**
   - Establish migration review process
   - Plan for production deployment
   - Consider CI/CD integration for automated migrations
